# Template: Module 4 Action Plan 
*This is your deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)*

## Module 4 Goals
*List your longterm goal(s) of what you want to accomplish by the end of module 4*

	* be employed
	* be proficient in rails/sql/ruby/js
	* create a purposeful project that can be prepetuated indefinitely

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day

	* work on a handful of apps at a time
	* codecademy/exercisms/interviewcake
	* typing
	* vim and hotkeys

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
*How will you focus your learning to accomplish your longterm goal?*

	* constantly working on old projects
	* constantly creating new projects

#### Opportunities Research:
*How will you continue researching companies and contacts? How will you utilize your Trello Board?* 

	* need to research Trello further

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
*Who will you reach out to? Have you considered talking with alumni about their own networking practices when they started their job search?

	* I have already started building my network and will start contacting 	them after I have officially passed mod 3.

### Timeline:
*What will you do when?*
	
	* possibly going to take a mod off after mod 3 to ensure I have 		retained everything necessary to complete a mod 4 personal project 	and/or become employed.
	* otherwise, I will do the same process of taking roughly 6 weeks off 	to reiterate what I’ve learned and/or learn job relevant material until 	I’m employed.

#### Module Tasks:
*What will you do throughout the module?*

	* i will do my best to take away what we need from this mod.

#### Weekly Tasks:
*What will you do throughout each week?*

	* complete all Turing assigned tasks.

## What I Will Work on with Meg
*What advice do you need? What would be helpful to talk through? Let Meg know here!*

	* I’d just like to get some interview simulations; coding and face to 	face
